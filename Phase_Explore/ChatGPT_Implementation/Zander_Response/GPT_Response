To import a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database, you can use the `COPY` command. Assuming you have a CSV file named "your_data.csv" with the following structure:

```csv
column1,column2,column3
value1_1,value1_2,value1_3
```

You can use the following PostgreSQL script to import this CSV file into a table:

```sql
-- Create a table to hold the data
CREATE TABLE your_table (
    column1 TEXT,
    column2 TEXT,
    column3 TEXT
);

-- Use the COPY command to import the CSV file
COPY your_table (column1, column2, column3)
FROM '/path/to/your_data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

-- Replace '/path/to/your_data.csv' with the actual file path
```

In this script:

1. We create a table named `your_table` with columns that match the structure of the CSV file.
2. We use the `COPY` command to import data from the CSV file. Make sure to replace `'/path/to/your_data.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file.
3. The `DELIMITER ','` option specifies that the CSV file uses a comma as the delimiter between values.
4. The `CSV HEADER` option indicates that the first line of the CSV file contains column names, which should be used as the column names for the table.

Execute this SQL script in your PostgreSQL database, and it will create the table and import the data from the CSV file.
